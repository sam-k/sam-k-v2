                <p><b>DURHAM, N.C.</b> — An uneasy tension loomed over the Oct. 26 meeting of the Durham Convention Center Authority as directors, board members and representatives sparred over the future of a fountain.</p>
                <p>“We’ve received a quote for the fixes of the fountain,” said Jina Propst, assistant director of the City of Durham Department of General Services, as the attendees frowned and sighed. “It’s around $26,000.”</p>
                <p>Installed almost 30 years ago, the large, cascading waterfall outside the center’s front doors has caused headaches for DCCA administrators for at least five years, due to its continual breakage followed by costly repairs. And the cycle seems to have no end in sight.</p>
                <p>“As is, it’s down half the year because it’s wintertime,” said Rebecca Bolton, the general manager of the convention center. And after the winter, she explained, turning the fountain back on causes the underground pipes to burst. Only in the summer, when all the repairs are complete, does the fountain finally reopen.</p>
                <p>“And it’s broken down again by the fall,” Bolton said.</p>
                <p>When Alice Sharpe, a DCCA board member, asked for a permanent fix, Bolton quickly dismissed the idea, saying the constant movement of water above concrete made damages inevitable—a comment that angered many in the audience, including Lew Myers, the interim president of Downtown Durham, Inc. and a board member of the DCCA.</p>
                <p>“It’s just throwing good money at the bad,” Myers said, before suggesting that the fountain be replaced with another, cheaper installation, like a “digital fountain.”</p>
                <p>While Bolton did not advocate for a holographic fountain as Myers did, she acknowledged his concerns. She reported that the center was considering other options, like a public art installation or a commissioned sculpture in the fountain’s place, or a nighttime LED display.</p>
                <p>Bolton said she had consulted with many contractors and developers of the American Tobacco Campus—the entertainment district in Downtown Durham with a thriving fountain system—to no success. She added that she would be happy to contact any commercial fountain companies that any of the attendees might recommend. If you know of such a firm that would be willing to provide additional consulting to the convention center, please contact Bolton at (919) 956-9404, ext. 102.</p>

                <h4>In Defense of the Fountain</h4>
                <p>Despite the financial concerns, some attendees defended the fountain for its aesthetic value.</p>
                <p>“The water’s wonderful,” said Bill Kalkhof, chair of the DCCA, who pushed for the preservation of the fountain while cutting costs. “One of my sons got married here. We have pictures in front of the water. It was really pretty cool.”</p>
                <p>Others were more forceful.</p>
                <p>“Details matter. How things look matters. And there’s a cost for it,” said Steven Hicks, director of Durham’s Department of General Services. “$2,000 a month—that’s just the cost of doing business.”</p>
                <p>Hicks emphasized the value of leaving memories and first impressions on visitors. He told attendees about the first time he walked to the convention center with his family, where his daughters played near the fountain and loved the water.</p>
                <p>“My 10-year-old daughter reminds me of it every time we go by there,” Hicks said.</p>

                <h4>A Dying Race</h4>
                <p>But the future seems bleak for the fountain. Maintenance costs have incurred at least $116,000 in the past six years, and city officials have floated the idea of converting the fountain into a landscape design since as early as January 2012, according to the earliest recorded minutes available.</p>
                <p>In fact, the fountain in the plaza is the last of its kind at the Durham Convention Center. According to Eric Melvin, a front desk clerk and a longtime employee at the center, the cascading fountain was once part of a massive water display project that coursed through the entire Durham Civic Center Complex.</p>
                <p>In the 1980s, a series of fountains started at the far end of the neighboring Marriott Hotel, its water flowing in an indoor river through the convention center lobby before culminating in a coin-tossing pond at the center’s entrance. The cascading fountain outside the front doors, as well as a trail of smaller pools dotting the plaza, gave the illusion that the water flowed into the huge fountain in front of the Durham Centre high-rise building across the street.</p>
                <p>“That was my favorite one. It was really pretty,” Melvin said. “Sometimes people would put detergent in it as a prank, and it would just soap up across the street.”</p>
                <p>The City of Durham killed all these fountains in the 1990s, paving them into the tile floors and grass patches seen today. And if the frequent closures and repairs are any indication, the cascading fountain appears to be next.</p>
                <p>“I just don’t know why it keeps closing so much,” Melvin said. “I guess it breaks a lot.”</p>
                <p>Duke University’s David Schaad, a professor of the practice of civil and environmental engineering with specialties in water resources and urban hydrology, said he did not know either.</p>
                <p>“I don’t know why it would keep breaking,” Schaad said, pointing to the fountains at Duke Gardens and at the national monuments in Washington as successful examples. “It’s not that hard to pressurize water.”</p>
