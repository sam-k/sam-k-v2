                <p>In her long-shot bid to unseat “<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article219776045.html">the most powerful man in state politics</a>,” Jen Mangrum, a Democratic candidate for state Senate, has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&q=jen mangrum">attacked</a> the 17-year incumbent on education, health care and the environment.</p>
                <p>“When Phil [Berger] uses his law office as his campaign headquarters, pays himself rent, $2,000 of campaign money—that’s corruption,” Mangrum said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/forncsenate/videos/2149906461899457/">Facebook campaign ad</a>. “That’s not transparency. That’s hurting the people that are helping him. That’s hurting North Carolinians.”</p>
                <p>In challenging Senate Leader Phil Berger, Mangrum faces an uphill battle. She is an education professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and a former Republican running in a redrawn district. But the N.C. FreeEnterprise Foundation, a nonpartisan political research group, still rates the race as “<a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/903dec_f4b11047d14b4f24b1e55d40672dc622.pdf">strongly Republican</a>,” and the district’s voters favored President Donald Trump by <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2017/s691maps/S691 4th Ed.Combined.pdf">67 percent</a> in 2016, according to the state elections board.</p>
                <p>Mangrum deleted the ad less than a week later, but we decided to investigate her claim anyway because of its impact. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/?active_status=inactive&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&page_ids[0]=151685312053726&q=I believe in government transparency. Phil Berger is gaining privilege and access in his role. Using his law office as his campaign headquarters, and paying himself rent using campaign money is wrong. He's hurting the people that are helping him, and hurting North Carolinians. If you believe in transparency in our government, share this post.">Facebook Ad Archive</a> showed her campaign and the state Democratic Party spent up to $600 promoting the ad, reaching up to 6,000 people.</p>
                <p>Also, we found some other interesting expenditures from Berger’s campaign ledger that the ad may have overlooked.</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Berger’s law firm charged the campaign up to $1,500 each month—not $2,000 as Mangrum claimed—transferring almost $100,000 over six years.</li>
                    <li>Berger’s campaign reported and explained these payments in public filings.</li>
                    <li>Such spending is allowed under North Carolina election law.</li>
                    <li>Berger’s campaign also paid $1,500 each month in “rent” to his shell company, not long after he and his wife had bought a townhouse in Raleigh.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Office Space for Lease</h4>
                <p>Berger, president pro tempore of the General Assembly, is running for election in the Virginia-bordering 30th state Senate District—the redrawn version of the 26th that he has represented for the last 15 years.</p>
                <p>And, according to campaign filings, he has been planning his re-election from his law office.</p>
                <p>Quarterly disclosure reports, sent to the State Board of Elections, show that Berger began transferring <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/ReportDetail/?RID=147737&TP=EXP">$1,200 each month</a> from his campaign to his law firm in October 2012. Three years later, that amount <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/ReportDetail/?RID=148142&TP=EXP">increased to $1,500</a>.</p>
                <p>In total, Berger paid himself at least $97,800 from his campaign for “rent, admin, supplies [and] telephone,” according to latest filings.</p>
                <p>The payments eventually drew scrutiny in 2016 from <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/ViewDocumentImage/?DID=211297">state auditors</a>.</p>
                <p>Steven Long, tax attorney and board member of the University of North Carolina, responded for the campaign, arguing that the payments were necessary. Office space is considered a <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_163A/GS_163A-1411.pdf">political contribution</a> under state law, he said, and providing the space for free would have constituted “an impermissible contribution from a corporation.”</p>
                <p>As for why the space was rented in the first place, campaign treasurer Amy Ellis explained in a <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/ViewDocumentImage/?DID=211297">memo</a> that the law firm is “the most convenient location for Senator Berger to conduct campaign and legislative business when not working on legal matters.”</p>
                <p>She went on to detail how Berger’s campaign reached the $1,500 amount. The rent for the space accounted for $600, and using the law firm’s secretary for the campaign was another $700. The rest went toward utilities, phone bills and the fax line for the office.</p>
                <p>Because the campaign occupies the office part-time, “a monthly charge of $1,500 represents a reasonable approximation of fair market rent for the office space and services that are leased to the Campaign,” Ellis wrote.</p>

                <h4>Was This Corrupt?</h4>
                <p>Election laws are ambiguous on acceptable campaign spending. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30114">Federal Election Commission</a> only requires that the spending be “in connection with the campaign” and would not exist otherwise. Though it lists some examples, office space is not one of them.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf">ethics manual</a> for the U.S. House of Representatives is more clear than the FEC’c guidelines. If a House member wishes to lease office space to his or her own campaign, the manual says, then there must be a “bona fide campaign need” for the space, for which the campaign must “not pay more than fair market value in the transaction.” The campaign should also consult with the ethics committee and document its own process for the record.</p>
                <p>But Berger is not a congressman, and the rules that govern the General Assembly are far looser than those for members of Congress.</p>
                <p>According to <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_163A/GS_163A-1433.pdf">state law</a>, candidates may use political donations only for “expenditures resulting from the campaign for public office”—which can mean anything from meals and hotel rooms to <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article209806434.html">handguns and Tomato Sandwich Day celebrations</a>, as well as office space.</p>
                <p>Though renting the Berger Law Firm’s office was well within the law, it is harder to judge whether the practice was corrupt as Mangrum claimed. To find out, we spoke to Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the General Assembly who worked as Raleigh’s legislative drafting director for 31 years.</p>
                <p>“It would hinge on whether he received any personal benefit from money paid for by donors to the campaign,” Cohen said. “In other words, is he profiting from campaign donors?”</p>
                <p>It does not appear so. If anything, Berger may be undercharging, not over-billing, his campaign.</p>
                <p>According to his campaign records, the office space of the Berger Law Firm—located in the remote town of Eden—is valued at $9.50 per square foot per year. To put that into perspective, Ellis also provided four “comparable rentals” nearby, with leases ranging from $7.32 to almost twice as much. Also, the online real estate site LoopNet lists a <a href="https://www.loopnet.com/for-lease/office/?bb=huq7j7h91H7_wn5B">vacant retail space</a> down the road from Berger’s office for $16.50—or about $2,900 per month.</p>
                <p>Because Berger’s campaign only uses the office part-time, the rent was discounted to just $6.50 per square foot per year.</p>
                <p>“By leasing space and services, the Campaign is able to have the benefit of a permanent office space ... for less than [half] the minimum expense of having a separate office,” his campaign treasurer wrote.</p>

                <h4>Was This Transparent?</h4>
                <p>Unlike corruption, there is little ambiguity with transparency.</p>
                <p>“Did [Berger] disclose all his contributions, and did he disclose the rental [of] his law firm for office space?” Cohen said. “If he did both of that, then it’s transparent.”</p>
                <p>Berger did do both. Though buried in almost two decades of paperwork, quarterly disclosures of Berger’s political donors and spending are publicly available on the state elections board’s <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/DocumentGeneralResult/?SID=STA-C0854N-C-001&OGID=1159">website</a>, as are the details of Berger’s office-space rental.</p>
                <p>These reports clearly state that the payments were $1,500 a month, not $2,000 as Mangrum had claimed. And, when we reached out to Mangrum, she confirmed this was the reason her campaign deleted the video ad against Berger.</p>
                <p>“The day I made the ad, I was talking from memory and I had incorrect information,” she wrote in the email.</p>
                <p>After reviewing the ad, Mangrum said she realized the error and alerted the production company, assuming they would not run it.</p>
                <p>“The company ran the ad anyway, I’m guessing as an oversight,” she wrote. “I immediately contacted the company when I first saw the ad on Facebook and told them to take it down... I refuse to post anything that is not fact-checked.”</p>
                <p>Though she apologized to us for the error, she maintained that the actual practice— Berger paying himself from his war chest—was factual.</p>
                <p>“I tried to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,” Mangrum wrote.</p>

                <h4>Follow the Money</h4>
                <p>As we investigated Mangrum’s claim, we found some unusual, less transparent entries in Berger’s ledger that caught our attention. Since Aug. 8, 2016, the Berger campaign had started paying YPD Properties, a limited liability company, for <a href="https://cf.ncsbe.gov/CFOrgLkup/ViewDocumentImage/?DID=202976">rent</a>. And, like the office-space rentals, these payments were also $1,500 a month.</p>
                <p>We were tipped off by Greg Flynn, a Raleigh architect who has filed an <a href="https://gregflynn.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/judicialinterferencecomplaintbergermoore.pdf">ethics complaint</a> against Berger and state House Speaker Tim Moore, both prominent Republicans. On his blog, Flynn <a href="https://gregflynn.wordpress.com/2018/02/23/berger-moore-judicial-interference-blurs-ethical-boundaries-separation-of-powers/">hinted</a> that the company’s name, “YPD,” formed the initials to Berger’s home address in Raleigh.</p>
                <p>A search through Wake County real estate records showed that Berger and his wife had <a href="http://services.wakegov.com/realestate/Account.asp?id=0365486">bought a $250,000 townhouse</a> on Yarborough Park Drive in May 2016. And YPD Properties’ <a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/Business_Registration_Results">business registration</a>, obtained from the North Carolina Secretary of State’s office, revealed that the company was formed just a month after the purchase, and that Berger was its manager.</p>
                <p>Of the 27 payments that the Berger campaign made to YPD Properties, all were listed as “rent” and “holding public office expenses”—consistent with the common practice among lawmakers of <a href="https://www.mcdowellnews.com/news/mcdowell-s-rep-josh-dobson-explains-campaign-spending-report/article_96075964-6584-11e6-84d6-5b765385d8ba.html">renting apartments near Raleigh</a> during legislative sessions. But Wake County tax records showed that Berger has been paying <a href="https://services.wakegov.com/ptax/main/billing/statement.aspx?pk=23575588">property taxes</a> on his Raleigh home.</p>
                <p>These payments were not included in the latest audit, which only examined campaign finances up to 2015.</p>
                <p>Berger’s legislative office did not immediately return calls for comment.</p>

                <h4>Our Ruling</h4>
                <p>Mangrum claimed that Berger had leased his own office to his campaign, making him corrupt and not transparent.</p>
                <p>But we found several flaws with her claim. Besides the misquoted figure, Berger’s campaign had publicly explained the payments to the state elections board, and we showed that the agreement was neither banned nor overpriced.</p>
                <p>We decline to give a rating on this claim. Though Mangrum got the facts wrong, she apologized for the error and voluntarily deleted her ad. We also found some dubious expenses from Berger’s campaign that may make us revisit our ruling in the future.</p>
